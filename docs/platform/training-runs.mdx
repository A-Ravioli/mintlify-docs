# Training Runs

Track all your fine-tuning jobs in real-time with comprehensive monitoring and detailed metrics.

## Viewing Runs

Navigate to `/signal/runs` or `/signal/monitors` to see:
- All your training runs
- Current status (Running, Completed, Failed)
- Progress and metrics
- Cost per run

## Run Status

Runs can have the following statuses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Queued">
    Run is waiting to start. It will begin when resources are available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Running">
    Training is in progress. Monitor metrics in real-time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Completed">
    Training finished successfully. Download checkpoints and view results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failed">
    Training encountered an error. Check logs for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cancelled">
    Run was manually cancelled or timed out.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring Runs

### Live Monitoring

The Live Monitors page (`/signal/monitors`) provides:
- Real-time updates (auto-refresh every 10 seconds)
- Filter by status (All, Running, Completed, Failed)
- Manual refresh button
- Progress indicators

### Run Details

Click on any run to see:
- **Overview**: Base model, status, duration, cost
- **Metrics**: Loss, learning rate, GPU utilization
- **Charts**: Visual progress of training metrics
- **Config**: Hyperparameters and training configuration
- **Logs**: Training output and error messages

## Metrics

Each run tracks:

- **Loss**: Training and validation loss
- **Learning Rate**: Current learning rate
- **GPU Utilization**: GPU usage percentage
- **Throughput**: Tokens/second processed
- **Cost**: Real-time cost tracking

## Creating Runs

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.frontier.com/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "base_model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B",
    "training_data": "s3://your-bucket/training-data.jsonl",
    "config": {
      "learning_rate": 0.0001,
      "batch_size": 4,
      "num_epochs": 3
    }
  }'
```

### Required Parameters

- `base_model`: The base model to fine-tune
- `training_data`: URL to your training dataset

### Optional Parameters

- `config`: Training hyperparameters
- `integration_ids`: IDs of integrations to use

## Checkpoints

After training completes:

1. Navigate to `/signal/checkpoints`
2. Find your completed run
3. Download checkpoints
4. View run metadata

<Note>
  Checkpoints are available for completed runs only. Make sure training finished successfully.
</Note>

## Cost Tracking

Each run shows:
- Estimated cost before starting
- Real-time cost during training
- Final cost after completion

Costs are based on:
- GPU type used
- Training duration
- Model size

## Troubleshooting

### Run stuck in "Queued"
- Check your credit balance
- Verify you have sufficient credits
- Check system availability

### Run failed immediately
- Review run logs for error messages
- Verify training data format is correct
- Check API key is valid

### Metrics not updating
- Refresh the page
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the run is still active

### Can't download checkpoints
- Ensure run completed successfully
- Check file permissions
- Verify checkpoint generation completed
