## Troubleshooting

### Integration not working
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check the key has proper permissions
- Ensure the service is accessible from our servers

### Metrics not appearing
- Verify the integration is active
- Check your API key hasn't expired
- Review service-specific requirements

### Key expired
- Generate a new API key from the service
- Update the integration with the new key
- Remove the old integration first
