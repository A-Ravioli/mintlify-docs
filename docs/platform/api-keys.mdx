# API Keys

API keys provide secure access to the Frontier API. This guide covers creating, managing, and using API keys.

## Creating API Keys

1. Navigate to `/signal/api-keys`
2. Enter a description for your key
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. **Copy the key immediately** - it's only shown once!

<Warning>
  API keys are only displayed once upon creation. Make sure to copy and store them securely!
</Warning>

## Key Security

- Keys are generated using cryptographically secure random generation
- Keys are hashed (SHA-256) before storage in the database
- Only the prefix and last 4 characters are displayed for existing keys
- Keys are validated against your credit balance before use

## Managing Keys

### Viewing Keys

You can see all your API keys at `/signal/api-keys`:
- Key prefix (e.g., `sk-...`)
- Last 4 characters
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp
- Active status

### Revoking Keys

1. Find the key you want to revoke
2. Click the "Revoke" button
3. Confirm the action

<Info>
  Revoked keys cannot be restored. You'll need to create a new key if needed.
</Info>

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.frontier.com/v1/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Best Practices

- **One key per application**: Create separate keys for different apps
- **Rotate regularly**: Revoke old keys and create new ones periodically
- **Store securely**: Never commit keys to version control
- **Monitor usage**: Check your dashboard regularly for unusual activity
- **Use environment variables**: Store keys in `.env` files, not in code

## Key Limits

- Maximum 10 active keys per user
- Rate limit: 5 key creations per hour
- Keys never expire (until revoked)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error
- Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check that the key hasn't been revoked
- Ensure the key is active in your dashboard

### "Insufficient credits" error
- Purchase credits to continue using the API
- Check your balance at `/signal/billing`

### Key not working
- Verify you're using the full key (not just the prefix)
- Check the key is active in your dashboard
- Ensure your account is in good standing
