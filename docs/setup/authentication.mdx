# Authentication Setup

This guide will help you set up Supabase authentication for your Frontier application.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (sign up at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- A Supabase project created

## Step 1: Get Your API Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL**: Your unique Supabase URL
   - **anon/public key**: Your anonymous public key

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add your credentials to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

<Warning>
  Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control!
</Warning>

## Step 3: Configure Email Authentication

For development, you may want to disable email confirmation:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
2. Under "Email Settings":
   - Toggle **Enable email confirmations** OFF for development
   - Toggle **Secure email change** OFF for development

<Note>
  For production, keep these enabled for security.
</Note>

## Step 4: Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs

1. Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set the following:
   - **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add:
     - `http://localhost:3000/`
     - `http://localhost:3000/signal`
     - `http://localhost:3000/login`

<Note>
  For production, add your production URLs as well.
</Note>

## Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Test the authentication flow:
   - Go to `/signup`
   - Enter an email and password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Click "Create account"
   - You should be redirected to the Signal dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" error
- Double-check that your environment variables are correct
- Make sure you've restarted your dev server after updating `.env.local`
- Verify you're using the **anon/public** key, not the service_role key

### Email confirmation not working
- Check your email spam folder
- For development, disable email confirmation in Supabase settings
- Verify your redirect URLs are configured correctly

### Session not persisting
- Check that middleware is properly configured
- Clear your browser cookies and try again
- Verify the Site URL in Supabase matches your development URL

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Add your production domain to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Add production environment variables to your hosting platform
3. Re-enable email confirmations for security
4. Consider setting up custom SMTP for email delivery
5. Set up proper password policies in Supabase settings
